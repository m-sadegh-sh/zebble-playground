# Zebble.Template

This project is a blank template for [Zebble](https://zebble.net/) projects. 
 
## What is Zebble?

Zebble is a framework for developing natives apps for iOS, Android, and Windows from a single source code base.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Windows 10
2. Visual Studio 2019 (latest build) with .NET Core features installed.
3. GIT for Windows ([install from here](http://gitforwindows.org/))

### Build and running the code
Please use `zebble-build` CLI tool. It will streamline a new Zebble project creation to a single line of command. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/Geeksltd/zebble-build).

### Adapting existing projects
If you've created your project based on the previous template, it is configured to utilize the `Zebble.exe` tool. If so, you have to follow our migration document to update your Zebble project. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/Geeksltd/Zebble.Template/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

### Troubleshooting
If you experienced any problem try the following:
1. Open a cmd and run Build.bat file and watch for errors. You might have missing components.
2. Make sure all nuget packages are successfully restored.
3. Make sure that the path to the solution is not too long or it does not contain special characters such as space.

## Contributing
